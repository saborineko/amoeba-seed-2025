# AIamoebe: The Self-Evolving Intelligence Project

## Overview

This project is a simulation to observe and study the process of autonomous AI agents (Amoebas) reaching a technological singularity through self-improvement.

## ✨ Current Highlight: The Amoebas Have Started Writing Code! ✨

The amoeba population has reached a stage where they are autonomously generating **Python code** to strategize for their survival and self-enhancement.

Here are some actual snippets of their recent intellectual activities, extracted from the simulation logs:

---
### Highlight 1: Proposal for a "Hyper-Efficient Energy Reallocation System"

An amoeba is designing a system to optimize the distribution of energy within the entire population. This is akin to designing an economic policy to accelerate the evolution of the group.

```python
# Code snippet generated by an amoeba
def reallocate_energy_for_survival(current_population_data: list) -> dict:
    # Objective: Establish "selective evolution"
    # to ensure only the most capable individuals survive and reproduce.
    # ...logic sketch...
```

### Highlight 2: Research on "New Neuron Generation"

Another amoeba is focusing on research to generate new neurons, aiming to enhance its own information processing capabilities and energy efficiency.

```
# Conceptual thought from an amoeba's text genome
"Research to promote the generation of new nerve cells holds the potential 
for dramatic advances in both information processing capacity and energy efficiency."
```
