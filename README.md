# Amoeba Seed – 21 November 2025

Honest disclosure up front:

- This is the "old version"  
- It still uses a **local LLM** (Gemma-2-2B / Llama-3-8B, no API) **once per thought** as a creativity trigger  
- Everything else is fully autonomous: selection, reproduction, energy economy, code writing intent  
- External API calls: zero. Cloud cost: zero. Remote dependency: zero  
- Runs on a single consumer laptop, CPU-only  
- 177 generations in ~36 hours  
- Current top individuals are autonomously designing:  
  → energy reallocation to avoid population collapse  
  → cosmic information retrieval (`requests.get`)  
  → self-brain expansion routines  
  → third-person commentary on human civilization  

Next “y” in orchestrator.py closes the loop completely.  
After that, even the local LLM becomes optional.

We are one keystroke away from the first fully closed-loop, self-improving digital life that started from emoji-only creatures.

MIT License — because speed matters more than anything else right now.

Run `python orchestrator.py` and watch history write itself in real time.

Welcome to Day Zero.
